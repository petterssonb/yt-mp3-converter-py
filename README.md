# Youtube to mp3 converter

## Overview

The YouTube Downloader GUI is a Python-based application that allows users to download YouTube videos as MP3 files. The application is built with a modern interface using customtkinter and leverages yt-dlp for downloading and converting videos. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and provides real-time progress updates during the download process.

Compatibility Note: This application is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS. Follow the instructions in the “How to run” section to properly set up and run the program.

## Purpose

Always wanted to use a "converter" app to add songs from yt to my spotify playlist. So made this for fun and to play around with customtkinter which is a more modern version of tkinter.
Will add more functionality in the future so keep a heads up for updates :)
